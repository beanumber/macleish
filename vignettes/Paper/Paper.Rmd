# Abstract

The ``MacLeish R package`` was created to analyze weather and spatial data on a patchwork of forest based on the Ada and Archibald MacLeish Field Station. The MacLeish Field Station is 260-acre of forest and farmland located in West Whately, MA. Data on weather conditions, including historical and current meteorological readings such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall, is available through the ETL framework. Similarly, spatial data as maps exists through Shapefiles for contextualizing spatial information. This package presents the opportunity for faculty, students, and other researchers to manipulate data and execute research pertaining to the forest. 

# Statement of Need 

- Enhancing accessibility for data to nonstatisticans 
- Presenting current and historical meteorological data on forestry 
- Creating the opportunity for expansion on ecological, conservation, and biodiversity research

# MacLeish R Package Main Functionalities

- Use of 2015 weather data from both Whately and Orchard weather stations 
- Live weather readings from Whately and Orchard weather stations 
- Maps of MacLeish 
- Two plot datasets on change in tree diameter in Hemlock Woolly Adelgid dominated areas 

# Application and Perspectives 

Figures can be plotted like so:

- Initial uses 
- Future applications
