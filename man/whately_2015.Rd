\title{Weather data from Macleish Field Stations}
\format{
For both, a data frame (\code{\link[dplyr:tbl_df]{dplyr::tbl_df()}}) with roughly 52,560 rows and 8 or 9 variables.

The following variables are values that are found in either the \code{whately_2015}
or \code{orchard_2015} data tables.

All variables are averaged over the 10 minute interval unless otherwise noted.
\describe{
\item{when}{Timestamp for each measurement set in Eastern Standard Time.}
\item{temperature}{average temperature, in Celsius}
\item{wind_speed}{Wind speed, in meters per second}
\item{wind_dir}{Wind direction, in degrees}
\item{rel_humidity}{How much water there is in the air, in millimeters}
\item{pressure}{Atmospheric pressure, in millibars}
\item{rainfall}{Total rainfall, in millimeters}
\item{solar_radiation}{Amount of radiation coming from the sun, in Watts/meters^2. Solar measurement for Whately}
\item{par_density}{Photosynthetically Active Radiation (sunlight between 400 and 700 nm), in average density of Watts/meters^2. One of two solar measurements for Orchard}
\item{par_total}{Photosynthetically Active Radiation (sunlight between 400 and 700 nm), in average total over measurement period of Watts/meters^2. One of two solar measurements for Orchard}
}

An object of class \code{tbl_df} (inherits from \code{tbl}, \code{data.frame}) with 52547 rows and 9 columns.

\description{
Weather data collected at the Macleish Field Station in Whately,
MA during 2015.
}
\details{
The Macleish Field Station is a remote outpost owned by Smith
College and used for field research. There are two weather stations on the
premises. One is called \code{WhatelyMet} and the other is \code{OrchardMet}.

The \code{WhatelyMet} station is located at (42.448470, -72.680553) and
the \code{OrchardMet} station is at (42.449653, -72.680315).

\code{WhatelyMet} is located at the end of Poplar Hill Road in Whately,
Massachusetts, USA. The meteorological instruments of \code{WhatelyMet} (except the
rain gauge) are mounted at the top of a tower 25.3 m tall, well above the
surrounding forest canopy. The tower is located on a local ridge at an
elevation 250.75m above sea level.

\code{OrchardMet} is located about 250 m north of the first tower in an open
field next to an apple orchard. Full canopy trees (~20 m tall) are within
30 m of this station. This station has a standard instrument configuration
with temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and barometric
pressure measured between 1.5 and 2.0 m above the ground. Wind speed and
direction are measured on a 10 m tall tower and precipitation is measured
on the ground. Ground temperature is measured at 15 and 30 cm below the
ground surface 2 m south of the tower. The tower is located 258.1 m above
sea level. Data collection at OrchardMet began on June 27th, 2014.

The variables shown above are weather data collected at \code{WhatelyMet} and
\code{OrchardMet} during 2015. Solar radiation is measured in two different ways:
see \code{SlrW_Avg}or the \code{PAR} variables for Photosynthetic Active Radiation.

Note that a loose wire resulted in erroneous temperature reading at OrchardMet
in late November, 2015.
