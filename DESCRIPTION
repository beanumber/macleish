Description: Download data from the Ada and Archibald MacLeish Field 
    Station in Whately, MA. The Ada 
    and Archibald MacLeish Field Station is a 260-acre patchwork of 
    forest and farmland located in West Whately, MA that provides opportunities 
    for faculty and students to pursue environmental research, outdoor 
    education, and low-impact recreation 
    (see <http://www.smith.edu/ceeds/macleish.php> for more information). 
    This package contains 
    weather data over several years, and spatial data on various man-made and 
    natural structures.
